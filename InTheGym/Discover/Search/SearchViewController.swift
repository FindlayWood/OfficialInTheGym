// MARK: - IMPORTANT!
/// Text search is not supported by Firebase which makes this feature tricky
/// They have some suggestions to use third parties to search but these seem to be for Firestore and cost money
/// So the only solution i can see that might work is as follows
///
/// Create three separate searches for firstname, lastname and username using the below method
/// Ending the query with uf8ff is a very high code point in the Unicode range and it is after most regular characters in Unicode
///
/// databaseReference.orderByChild('_searchFirstName')
///    .startAt(queryText)
///    .endAt(queryText+"uf8ff")
