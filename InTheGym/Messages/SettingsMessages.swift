    static let howToMakeMostOfAppMessage = "InTheGym was designed for people to create and share workouts. Whether part of a team or individually, creating and sharing workouts is important for improving and having fun. We encourage creating and sharing the workouts you enjoy doing. You may find workouts or exercises that you come to love. We encourage following users who you enjoy seeing from or who have inspired you. We encourage leaving positive comments on posts and workouts to make InTheGym enjoyable for everyone. You will get the most out of the app by interacting positively with other users. The best place to look for more info on how to use the app and discover all the features is our instagram page. Our website is currently beign updated and so does not provide the most up to date information. \n\nThe NEWSFEED will show you all posts from you and anyone you follow. When creating a post you will have the option to make it PUBLIC or PRIVATE. Public posts can be seen by anyone who views your profile, private posts can only be seen by users who follow you. You can like posts by tapping the star. You can reply to the post by firstly tapping on the post, this will show you all the replies to the post and present you with a button to add your own reply. The poster will be notified when you like or reply to their post. You can make written posts by tapping on the pencil button in the top right of the NEWSFEED page. (Currently we do not support the use of emojis. They will not appear in any posts. We are working to add them in!) \n\nThe DISCOVER page is a great place to discover new users to follow and new workouts to add. The Workout Of the Day (WOD), is shown at the top of the page and this workout has been hand picked by us as we beleive it is particularly good. The workouts below are ordered by the number of downloads. When you create a workout (not a LIVE WORKOUT), you will have the option to make it public or private. If you choose public then the workout will be submitted to the DISCOVER page and may be selected as the WOD. Private workouts will not appear on the DISCOVER page. \n\nSaving workouts will allow you to add them to your workout list at anytime as many times as you like. You will also be able to see the workout stats such as average time to complete the workout and average RPE score given. The Created workouts list allows you to see all the workouts you created. As your saved workouts list may contain workouts created by other users. \n\nSENDING AND RECEIVING REQUESTS. A coach may send a request to a player. If the player accepts the request then the coach user will be able to see the player user's account in much more detail, including contact info. So it is important that you ONLY ACCEPT REQUESTS FROM PEOPLE YOU KNOW. This function was design to allow a coach of a team or peronal trainer with clients to interact more personally with their players/clients. \n\nGROUPS are a great way to interact with a specific set of users more personally. Each group has their own timeline where any group member can post to. This timeline is private and only visible to the members of the group. A coach user can create a workout for all members of a group from the group page using the + icon in the top right of the screen."
